# Take-Will-Code_Quiz

This project involved using css, javascript and html.
I used html to setup the back bone for the webpage and the static page. Javascript was used to dynamically display question and answer choices for the quiz. As long as the timer still has time and there are still question left, the javascript will grab and display the question and multiple choices. Whenever the multiple choices got displayed, I also attached an attribute value that will contain the text of that answer choice. So when the user clicked on that answer choice, I can grab that value attribtue and compare it to the correct answer.
The score is save to a local storage, then it will get display on the score.html page in a descending order. 
Since we are using flex box, I don't have to worry about the screen size. It will just flex depending on the size.
Ideal for future improvement, I can created an UI where I can let the user enter his/her own question and answer choices. I can also dynamically set the width of the multiple choices so that it will be set to the longest string.
